# Ubuntu Touch for Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (gta4xl)

## Current status
The kernel builds and boot image and rootfs image can be created!
However, on flashing the boot image and pushing the rootfs to /data as ubuntu.img and rebooting, the device stays on the Samsung logo, and nothing shows up in dmesg.

### Will it be fixed?
Most likely, no. This was just a side project to see if I could get Ubuntu running on my tablet, but time and other affairs stop me from progressing any further than this. You can use this repository as a base for your own port of this device.
